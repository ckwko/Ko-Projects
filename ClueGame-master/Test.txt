For the testRoomLabels, we just added all of our rooms and their names to the test to make 
sure that they are being loaded. For testBoardDimensions, we just copied the code since it
should just be returning whatever the variable we have is holding. For fourDoorDirections,
we selected the door at the right of Medbay for our LEFT door, the door at Navigation for 
our UP door, the door at Storage for our DOWN door, and the left door at Reactor for our 
RIGHT door. To test the number of doorways we just went through the whole .csv file and 
counted the number of doors that we had in the file.
